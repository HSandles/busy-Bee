Busy Bee – The Illusion of Relentless Productivity
Welcome to Busy Bee, a tongue-in-cheek GitHub project that automates daily commits to make you look like a nonstop coding machine — even when you're just enjoying lunch.

What It Does
This repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow to:

Run a Python script once a day at 12:00PM UK time

Append a unique, timestamped line to daily_commit.txt

Commit the change with a random, developer-themed message

Push the commit back to GitHub

✅ Trigger those sweet, sweet green squares on your profile

All fully automated. No local scripts. No manual input. No actual productivity.

How It Works
GitHub Actions is configured in .github/workflows/daily_commit.yml

It triggers on a daily cron schedule (and supports manual runs too)

The Python script daily_commit.py:

Generates a unique line with a timestamp and UUID

Adds it to daily_commit.txt

Commits it with a random message from a list

Pushes it using the GITHUB_TOKEN provided by GitHub

Example Commit Messages
“Deleted 400 lines of bad code”

“Refactored the refactor”

“Moved a div, felt alive”

“Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V excellence”

Because who has time for real work when there are commit graphs to fill?

Why Use This?
To keep your GitHub contribution graph looking active

As a fun automation project to experiment with GitHub Actions

To flex on your team during stand-up

Or just to mess with your future self in job interviews

How to Trigger Manually
You can go to the Actions tab in GitHub and click "Run workflow" if you want an instant green square or to test the setup.
